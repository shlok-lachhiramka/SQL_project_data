Key Trends in Top-Paying Data Analyst Skills

-> Specialization in Niche Technologies: Many top-paying skills are tied to specialized tools or programming languages outside of traditional data analytics 
   such as SVN (version control), Solidity (blockchain), Couchbase (NoSQL database), and Golang (modern programming language). These niche competencies command 
   higher salaries due to their relative scarcity and demand in cutting-edge sectors.

-> High Demand for Automation, Cloud, and ML Tools: Proficiency in automation (Terraform, Puppet, Ansible), cloud infrastructure (VMware), 
   and machine learning frameworks (DataRobot, MXNet, Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face) consistently ranks high. This highlights that 
   organizations are willing to pay more for data analysts who can deploy, scale, and automate advanced analytics and AI solutions.

-> Emphasis on Modern Data Ecosystem & Collaboration: Many top skills relate to distributed data systems (Kafka, Cassandra, Airflow), 
   collaborative DevOps platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket, Atlassian), and data science libraries (dplyr, Scala). 
   Mastery of the broader modern data and engineering ecosystem is highly valued for supporting data collaboration and streamlined workflows.
